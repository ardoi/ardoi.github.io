I'm Ardo and at the moment I [work][1] as a postdoctoral fellow in the lovely [capital city][3] of Switzerland. My current research deals with calcium handling in cardiac myocytes, but previously I've worked on a bunch of different cardiac related  [stuff][2]. 

Python is my weapon of choice and I have a lot of fun using and writing tools for processing, analyzing and visualizing data. In this blog I try to write about some of the things I've had the pleasure of playing around with.
