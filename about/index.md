I'm Ardo and I help people decide where is their best place in this wide world by doing data science at [Teleport][4]. Previously I was a [postdoc][1] working on a computational biophysics in cardiac related  [topics][2] in the lovely [capital city][3] of Switzerland. 

Python is my weapon of choice and I have a lot of fun using and writing tools for processing, analyzing and visualizing data. In this blog I try to write about some of the things I've had the pleasure of playing around with.
